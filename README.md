# Midterm Election Forecast
Democrats take the Senate but not the House and by very few seats and votes.

I think liberal voters have been energized and some districts will flip. However, I also think Republican voters are currently less likely to share their political leanings with reporters and pollsters at the moment, as many big news companies lean liberal. Thus, they will come out in bigger numbers than expected on election day. I also think more democrats than republicans have been affected by voter registration problems. 

### Specific Race Predictions
- Gretchen Driskell (D) beats Walberg in Michigan's 7th District
- Poliquin (R) wins in Maine's 2nd District
- Handel (R) outpaces MacBath (D) in Georgia's 6th District
